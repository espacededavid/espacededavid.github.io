                    <h1>Week 11: Avant-Garde</h1>
                    <p>Avant-garde form and style instead provides us with an opportunity to see the world from an atypical vantage point – it allows for unexpected and unorthodox connections among objects and ideas.</p>
                    <p>The body of work known as avant-garde cinema is incredibly wide-ranging and diverse, and it contains films from many historical periods and many national and transnational contexts. Because of this diversity, the avant-garde is a type of film that is hard to define with clear and concrete borders. Nonetheless, we are going to attempt to do so by outlining on two broad features. The first of these has to do with the circumstances surrounding its production, distribution, and reception.</p>
                    <p>First of all, avant-garde films are typically characterized by an artisanal (rather than industrial) mode of production.</p>
                    <p>By this, I mean that they are typically made by a single artist or, at most, a skeletal crew. They are not industrially produced and distributed by large studios but are instead independently made, often in an underground or counter-cultural context.</p>
                    <p>Second of all, avant-garde films are typically distributed and exhibited outside of commercial contexts.</p>
                    <p>This means that their distribution and circulation is limited to exhibition at specialized events like experimental film festivals and in specialized spaces like museums, galleries, universities, and alternative film venues.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the third thing to note about avant-garde work is the fact that it is made for a decidedly small and specialized audience.</p>
                    <p>Experimental cinema doesn't court the mass audience; it's rather happy appealing to a select but loyal following.</p>
                    <p>The second way we are going to define avant-garde cinema is in terms of a shared priority.</p>
                    <p>Although individual avant-garde works may have different specific aims, collectively the avant-garde is united by the following shared goal, which it prioritizes above all others:</p>
                    <p>To reject established cinematic conventions in order to expand the possibilities of the medium, and in particular, to reject the conventions that have allowed for film to become, first and foremost, a means of storytelling. This does not mean that avant-garde films all completely reject the very notion of storytelling – as we will see, some of our examples that we're watching today do not. But what they do reject as a group is the notion that cinema exists to tell stories as its primary reason for being.</p>
                    <p>As Scott MacDonald argues in the essay on Quercus that you are reading this week, this means that the work of the avant-garde is, at least implicitly or on some level, an act of criticism or critique.</p>
                    <p>How exactly then does avant-garde film reject established conventions in order to expand the possibilities of film?</p>
                    <p>In answering this question, we could point to any number of specific projects that avant-garde films have been engaged in, especially since these films range so widely in character...</p>
                    <p>...but nonetheless it is possible to isolate four projects that are especially prevalent.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By abandoning or radically questioning narrative. When a film is abstract in organization, the presentation and arrangement of material is dictated by specific visual and/or aural qualities. This means that what is of concern to the filmmaker is not what the sound track and image track mean, but literally what they look and sound like -- how they draw our attention to color, to line, to luminosity, to texture, to composition, to rhythm, to tone -- in short, to form. Bordwell and Thompson note that abstract doesn't necessarily mean that there will be no recognizable elements in the film, but rather these elements are presented in a way that emphasizes their formal qualities, the colours and shapes, and they are often organized around themes and variations. Other avant-garde films are associational in form, meaning that their material is presented and arranged largely on the principle of metaphor through juxtaposition, or montage. In other words, in the case of these films, images and sounds are rendered and combined so as to create connections that are not exclusively formal in nature. Associations are forged initially through images of stasis, slumber, a lack of animation or operation, an existence unto itself and not in interaction with other figures.</li>
                        <li>By systematically exploring the formal potential of the medium. Typically, avant-grade cinema is interested in exploring as much as possible the specific ways in which film form can transform the world. filmmakers may, for example, experiment with different kinds of lenses, filters, and optical techniques … OR, they may experiment with the kinds of non-narrative relations that editing can forge between disparate images. One reason they do this is, again, in order to produce a cinematic experience that allows us to see the world with fresh eyes. Other filmmakers may explore the formal potential of the medium by engaging in a stringent exploration of a single aspect of film form or a single film technique. And these exercises are as much meditations on the nature of film as they are attempts to use film to make us see the world differently. Still other filmmakers might explore the medium's potential by moving away from film's photographic base altogether so as to use celluloid as a kind of canvas on which they scratch, etch, draw, or apply pigment.</li>
                        <li>A third way avant-garde films challenge cinematic conventions is by questioning and perhaps disrupting social norms.</li>
                        <li>Finally, the last way avant-garde films challenge cinematic conventions is by constructing personal mythologies. In some ways, this can be seen to follow out of the previous point. Avant-garde artists, because they know their work will only be seen by a limited number of people, are free to make that work as intensely personal as they wish. Not all experimental filmmakers do so, but many have used their films as an opportunity to construct an idiosyncratic universe wherein their own obsessions, fears, desires, and beliefs come to the forefront. The result are films that range from the intensely autobiographical to the broadly mythological, from the relentlessly confessional to the stridently interrogative.</li>
