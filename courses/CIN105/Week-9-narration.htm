                    <h1>Week 9 Narration</h1>
                    <p>Narration is the process by which story information is made available to us via the plot.</p>
                    <p>To review, plot is the actual arrangement of narrative material which the film makes available to us, while the story is what we construct from the plot provided. While plot refers to those story events that are directly or explicitly represented in a film, narration refers to the manner in which those story events are presented to us. In other words, narration involves not just what the plot presents to us, but also how it does so.</p>
                    <p>To study narration is to study the way a film "regulat[es] our access to a fluctuating field of information." It demands posing the following question to ourselves as we watch a movie: "How is it possible for us to possess the knowledge we come to possess in a narrative?" Anothr way to frame this might be: how does this flux of transmission constantly reshape my understanding of what is happening, what might come next, and what came before?</p>
                    <p>We can say narration is precisely that thing that serves to link the narrative system -- story and plot -- and the stylistic system, our two distinct formal systems that interact to produce an individual film's unique form.</p>
                    <p>Narration puts style in the service of telling us a story.</p>
                    <p>And narration uses style to realize, to bring into being, or to represent a film's plot.</p>
                    <h2>We are going to analyze narration in terms of three factors:</h2>
                    <h3>1. Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>Knowledge pertains to how much and what kind of information the narration provides and it is typically described in terms of two dimensions that you all are already familiar with: range and depth.</p>
                    <p>In terms of the range of knowledge a film produces, the range of information it offers, it can run the gamut from restricted to unrestricted.</p>
                    <p>We say that the narration of a film is restricted if it deliberately limits our knowledge to that possessed by a single character. In an extreme case, our knowledge might even be less than that of a single character.</p>
                    <p>In contrast, we call narration unrestricted if our knowledge is greater than that of the characters, if it includes information about events and people outside of their experience, things the characters couldn't possibly know.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to depth of narration, we say that a film engages in subjective narration if the type of information it presents us with is that related to a character's interiority or to the world as seen through their eyes.</p>
                    <p>While we say a film engages in objective narration if the information presented pertains to the external world and is experienced from a disembodied perspective.</p>
                    <p>Very often films vacillate between subjective and objective narration in an ongoing and dynamic manner. These are not terms that often describe an entire film but terms that are in flux -- one shot to the next could change the depth of narration we are receiving.</p>
                    <h3>2. Communicativeness</h3>
                    <p>(communicative/uncommunicative)</p>
                    <p>Communicativeness involves the degree to which the narration willingly supplies information when it can be made available.</p>
                    <p>In other words, the question at hand when analyzing this factor is: does the narration display a tendency to reveal whatever information it can at any given moment, or does it withhold information deliberately for some reason?</p>
                    <p>Restricted narration does often involve a certain degree of uncommunicativeness since a film may very well be withholding certain information by narrowing its focus on one character.</p>
                    <h3>3. Self-Consciousness</h3>
                    <p>The manner in which narration announces its recognition of its address to the audience is a question of self-consciousness.</p>
                    <p>A self-conscious narration wants you, the viewer, to think about the fact that you are watching a movie, and to overtly think about the message that the movie is intended to deliver. It wants to pull you OUT of immersion, the opposite of the desire for total immersion that the continuity system, which most of the film adheres to, typically strives for.</p>
                    <p>As far as the opposite of self-conscious narration, there is no specific term reserved for such a thing. This is largely because most narration is not that self-conscious -- it strives to suck you into the story and therefore intentionally effaces its own construction as much as possible. So, if we had to label the opposite, we might just call it "un-self-conscious." Or we could borrow a term associated with continuity editing and speak of "invisible narration."</p>
                    <p>Another term we will use and have used to describe this quality is "reflexiveness" â€“ we say a film is self-reflexive to indicate the idea that it is, in part, reflecting on itself as a film.</p>
