                    <h1>Week 8: Style</h1>
                    <p>This is the week we consider more than simply a film's mise en scene, or cinematography, or music, or editing -- this is when we start to think about how all of these components work together; how they relate to each other; and how they function symbiotically to influence the audience's audiovisual experience. In particular, we want to think about how a specific or individual filmmaker uses the techniques that we have been learning about deliberately and to specific ends.</p>
                    <p>We look at style to think about what the film is communicating and what the combination of images and sound are doing, and how we might interpret their meaning.</p>
                    <p>Style is an interactive system that depends upon the integration of different elements to produce a distinctive pattern.</p>
                    <p>Distinctive styles can help distinguish the works of filmmakers.</p>
                    <h2>Four questions that facilitate the process of analyzing style:</h2>
                    <h3>1. What is the film's overall form?</h3>
                    <p>When determining a film's overall form, you need to be thinking about...</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The general relationship between that film's plot and its story</li>
                        <li>The means by which the film develops over time</li>
                        <li>The ways that it employs devices such as repetition, variation, parallelism, and motifs over the course of its development and in service of its development</li>
                        <li>The extent to which it provides the spectator with information or withholds it as it progresses</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We might think of the film's overall form as relating to its narrative form, how it is structured and put together.</p>
                    <h3>2. What are the primary techniques being used?</h3>
                    <p>A couple of steps involved in answering this question:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First, it is necessary to identify the techniques used. Multiple techniques have the capacity to denote the same action -- that is, to signify that action directly or to convey that action as the literal meaning of a scene. However, each of those different techniques will connote something different, will suggest or imply different things in addition to communicating the literal meaning of something. I can connote all of those things through the choices in the cinematography, the mise en scene, or even the music I play over the image.</li>
                        <li>Once you've identified the techniques used in any given scene in a film, then you can identify the primary and salient techniques used most often. Which ones does the film rely most heavily on? Which techniques are stressed over others? Which ones serve to determine other elements?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>3. What patterns are formed by the techniques?</h3>
                    <p>When we think about patterns in film style, we are thinking about recurring techniques, recurring ideas.</p>
                    <p>As a note, one thing to remember about patterns of style is that their disruption is just as important as their introduction.</p>
                    <p>But the point, generally, is that we want to look at our shot by shot breakdown and consider if there seems to be any ornamentation, any recurring motif.</p>
                    <h3>4. What functions do the techniques and patterns fill?</h3>
                    <p>In order to do that, you need to start by asking yourself certain questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does a repeated technique operate in the same or a similar way from one use to the next?</li>
                        <li>How does it direct my attention and/or affect me as a spectator, intellectually, physically, and emotionally?</li>
                        <li>Does it create similar expectations each time it is employed?</li>
                        <li>Does it affect other elements in the same way from one instance to the next?</li>
                        <li>If not, what variations are evident?</li>
                        <li>At what points in the plot's -- or story's -- development does it appear?</li>
                    </ul>
