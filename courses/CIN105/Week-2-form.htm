                    <h1>Week 2: Form</h1>                    
                    <p>What we are talking about when we speak of a film's "form" – we mean: what is the shape of this thing, how is it structured, how was it molded by its creators and what is the final way in which it exists, ready to be seen by us, the viewer.</p>
                    <p>Bordwell, Thompson and Smith, the authors of your textbook, define film form as "the overall set of relationships among a film's parts."</p>
                    <p>Film form describes the overall way in which a film's components are structured in relation to one another.</p>
                    <p>To understand form better it might help us, in fact, to distinguish it from "content." If form is the container or shape or set of relationships between the parts of an artwork, then content is the stuff of the artwork -- what its semantically about. In a film, some of the content might be the story, whereas the form is how that story is told.</p>
                    <p>Film form cannot only be a consideration of the relationship between a film's parts, because form has no effect if it is not being actively perceived and made sense of by a film viewer. In a real sense, no audience, no film. It is by being experienced that form produces meaning. The meaning lies not in the film per se, but in the middle somewhere, between viewer and film, in the act of perception.</p>
                    <p>So whenever we talk about form, and when we engage in formal analysis, what is at issue is a dynamic relationship between: The work of art, which has been created in and through a series of creative decisions on the part of the filmmakers and now exists in some final state and the audience, which is addressed by that work of art and, in turn, becomes actively engaged in deciphering it by picking up on various CUES that have the potential to provoke a particular emotional response.</p>
                    <p>In other words, we could define "form" as that which connects the filmmaker to the audience. It means that despite what we may assume, meaning does not reside entirely within the art work, waiting to be discovered by the perceiver; NOR does it reside entirely in a viewer who projects it on to an art work, as if that art work were a blank canvas. Another way to put this is artworks should not be thought of as entirely objective -- existing with a stable set of meanings that are available to be discovered -- nor should the interpretation of art be thought of as entirely subjective, where any meaning can be imposed on a work because I'm allowed to think whatever I want about it. Instead, we need to understand that meaning is the result of a collaborative effort between an artwork that provides cues and a viewer that perceives and then interprets those cues in an active process that we call looking. Looking is an active process whereby we, as viewers, sense-make based on the negotiation between the objective formal properties of the work and our own personal experience of being subjects in the world.</p>
                    <h2>Principles of Film Form:</h2>
                    <h3>1. Function</h3>
                    <p>"If form is a pattern of elements, we would expect that those elements fulfill purposes. They do something in the larger whole. Of any element in a film we can ask, What are its functions?"</p>
                    <p>And the lesson to take from this first overriding principle is that we can learn more about the overall set of relationships that make up a film's form by simply asking of any element that stands out to us – a notable shot, a cut, or even the role of a certain character – what function does this serve the film as a whole? Why was this choice made and not another?</p>
                    <h3>2. Similarity and Repetition</h3>
                    <p>Many elements in films are repeated and become motifs – some are visual, others musical or sonic, or some might be situational.</p>
                    <p>Once you start to pay attention to the way ideas or elements repeat in the film, you will begin to notice the way many artworks find structure through this type of repetition.</p>
                    <h3>3. Difference and Variation</h3>
                    <p>Similarity and repetition finds its necessary counterpart in the third principle: difference and variation. In fact the two should be often thought of in tandem, because elements are often repeated broadly but differ slightly -- a musical motif may change ever so slightly as the film progresses.</p>
                    <h3>4. Development</h3>
                    <p>By comparing elements from different moments of the film, most obviously the beginning and the end, a progression of sorts can be charted. In other words, as elements undergo change, the dynamism of a film become apparent</p>
                    <h3>5. Unity/Disunity</h3>
                    <p>Typically, films will try to create a scenario in which everything fits, everything coheres. A scenario in which each element reinforces the presence of others. We say a film has unity when we want to describe its elements as tight – everything fits, there is little left unresolved or ambiguous, either intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
                    <p>A film may possess some level if disunity if narrative threads or codes of action are left unresolved – casually, viewers often describe instances like this as plot holes – gaps in narrative logic that are either unaddressed or simply do not make sense according to the rules of the story world.</p>
                    <p>That said, it is important to note that while many filmmakers strive for formal unity, some use disunity strategically —they might, for example, leave a certain strand of the narrative unresolved on purpose. In this sense, the filmmaker may want their film to feel ambiguous, they may want the viewer to leave the theatre unsure exactly what to think, unable to tie everything together neatly. As viewers we may find such examples of disunity jarring, but they are no less deliberate than those choices which create unity.</p>
                    <p>It is important to emphasize that any given film has multiple levels of meaning. We're going to talk today about about 4 levels outlined in your textbook.</p>
                    <h2>Levels of Meaning: </h2>
                    <h3>1. Referential meaning</h3>
                    <p>"This layer of meaning is very concrete, close to a bare-bones plot summary. Here the meaning depends on the spectator's ability to identify specific items... A viewer unacquainted with such information would miss some of the meanings cued by the film. We can call such tangible meanings referential, since the film refers to things or places already invested with significance in the real world."</p>
                    <p>So the referential meaning is close to as literal a description of what we see as possible.</p>
                    <h3>2. Explicit meaning</h3>
                    <p>"Still fairly concrete in the meaning it attributes to the film" and we might say that it is the overall point or message that the film's story is trying to get across.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">In both cases we are concerned more or less with the story of the film, in the first instance the events of the story and, in the second case, the lessons of that story. But we can also describe the film less in terms of story and more in terms of theme – which would activate its implicit and symptomatic meanings: these meanings are more abstract than the referential and explicit meanings, and interpretations of them may vary from person to person.</p>
                    <h3>3. Implicit meaning</h3>
                    <p>This layer of meaning involves an act of interpretation. To put it simply, the film may have a literal meaning (the referential), a fairly literal lesson (its explicit meaning), and then, if we read between the lines, a more implicit meaning, one that involves a leap of sorts on our part, but that is still based in the same story material as the first two meanings.</p>
                    <h3>4. Symptomatic meaning</h3>
                    <p>Broader implicit meanings that extend beyond the film itself to society at large.</p>
                    <p>Another term we will encounter later in the course for describing this level of meaning is "ideological" -- what does the film have to say as an object which exists within a broader social political landscape that is governed by certain norms and assumptions about the way the world works?</p>
                    <p>The symptomatic meaning extends beyond the film to society at large, and constitutes the ways in which the film articulates or engages with social values.</p>
                    <p>Bordwell and Thompson say: "Symptomatic meanings remind us that meaning of all sorts is largely a social phenomenon. Many meanings of films are ultimately ideological; that is, they spring from systems of culturally specific beliefs about the world. Religious beliefs, political opinions, conceptions of race or gender or social class, even our most deeply seated notions of life's values—all these constitute our ideological frame of reference."</p>
