                    <h1>Week 10 Documentary</h1>
                    <p>One thing that distinguishes documentaries from films that we've seen so far is that documentaries aren't always narratives. In addition to featuring narratives, documentaries can also be categorical or rhetorical in their organization.</p>
                    <p>Documentary has been defined as the "creative treatment of actuality." We might expand the definition, and say that documentaries are also defined by the expectations of those watching them. Those expectations are that the world on screen is, in some fundamental sense, real, and that the information being relayed about that world is trustworthy.</p>
                    <h2>Different kinds of documentary approaches:</h2>
                    <h3>1. expository mode</h3>
                    <p>example: "Nanook of the North"</p>
                    <p>First to emerge historically.</p>
                    <p>Techniques that we associate with this mode include explanatory commentary of some sort. In the silent era that commentary was delivered by way of intertitles. In the sound era, it has taken the shape of voice-over narration, whether it be provided by someone who never appears on screen, which is called voice of God narration, or by someone who does appear on screen, usually in the guise of an expert.</p>
                    <p>They also include the use of what are called reality effects: maps, statistics, charts, graphs. What this all adds up to: a film that locates the truth in an authoritative figure who assumes a posture of detachment and assumed objectivity as she or he crafts a well-supported argument, which is typically articulated verbally.</p>
                    <h3>2. observational mode</h3>
                    <p>example: "Primary"</p>
                    <p>Took shape through film movements like direct cinema and took advantage of emergent technologies that allowed the filmmaker to be extremely mobile.</p>
                    <p>As a result, the filmmaker conceives of their role as that of, at least in part, observer, and thus the spectator is forced into the position of having to take a more active role in determining the significance of what is said and done.</p>
                    <p>Formal techniques associated with this mode include: Hand-held camerawork (noteworthy for its responsiveness to the action more than the precision of its compositions). Very little, if any, acknowledgement of the camera on the part of the film's participants. An equal emphasis on sound and image. And, in some cases, especially those wherein multiple cameras are used to capture the action as it unfolds, a heavy reliance on editing. This type of film locates truth in a world that is allowed to speak for itself.</p>
                    <h3>3. participatory mode</h3>
                    <p>example: "Roger and Me"</p>
                    <p>It's modeled on the participant observer mode, and films made in this mode make visible the filmmaker's involvement in the act of gathering information and drawing conclusions.</p>
                    <p>As a result, the techniques they rely on include interviews and the on-screen appearance of the filmmaker who lays bare the idea that knowledge is produced rather than simply existing and that it is historically contingent rather than universal.</p>
                    <p>This type of film locates truth in the experience of certain historically situated individuals as they investigate and reflect on the world around them.</p>
                    <h3>4. poetic mode</h3>
                    <p>Similar to and often part of avant-garde and experimental filmmaking, as it emphasizes the aesthetic qualities and associations between images.</p>
                    <p>The goal is not to create a film with a traditional narrative but rather to look into presenting patterns and associations to create meaning and evoke an emotional response from the audience. This is often achieved by arranging imagery into rhythms and juxtapositions.</p>
                    <h3>5. reflexive mode</h3>
                    <p>Draws attention to the documentary as a constructed piece of work, often explicitly showing us the processes of making the documentary. This forces us to confront the unstable nature of representation as means to access to fundamental or objective truths.</p>
