                    <h1>Week 3: Narrative</h1>
                    <p>This week, we want to start to interrogate the specifics of a film's formal system. Films make meaning in and through their formal elements – cinematography, editing, mise en scene, and sound – and these formal properties operate through two different sub-systems that should be thought of as interrelated but semi-distinct -- these are the narrative system and the stylistic system.</p>
                    <p>Narrative, they say, is the very means by which we, as human beings, understand who we are, how we make sense of our place in the sociohistorical world.</p>
                    <p>When we narrativize, we inevitably choose which events are important and which ones aren't. We link certain actions and forget others. This is a process of human creativity, and needs to be understood as such. This is what storytelling is. It is a result of that chain that we construct in the act of storytelling that each event therein comes to assume a significance; that it comes to emerge as consequential. It is because of that chain that each event is revealed to be the effect of some prior event and perhaps the cause of some future one.</p>
                    <p>This brings us to B+T's definition of narrative in the cinema: "a chain of events linked by cause and effect and occurring in time and space."</p>
                    <p>One thing this definition puts immediately on the table is causality. The logic that fuels narratives, B+T argue, is causality; it's causality that determines how different events are linked together.</p>
                    <p>To understand better why this is the case, we need to learn some new terms that will help us distinguish the WHAT of the story from the HOW that story is told through form.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Story is the entire narrative of the film, incorporating both those events which are actually depicted on screen and those which we infer as having occurred</li>
                        <li>2. Plot, in contrast, is the ordering and presentation of those events as they occur in the film (that is to say, as they are seen by us directly, or told to us through dialogue).</li>
                        <li>Put another way, plot is the actual arrangement of narrative material which the film makes available to us, while the story is what we construct from the plot provided.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Diegesis refers to the world of the story. The non-diegetic refers to parts of the film that are not part of the film's story world. Most of the elements in a film belong to its diegesis, but some may not.</p>
                    <p>With that distinction between diegetic and non-diegetic, we can further adjust our definitions of story and plot:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Story: involves both explicitly presented + implied events</li>
                        <li>2. Plot: includes both explicitly presented events + additional nondiegetic material</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The next important element we need to highlight from this definition is this notion here -- that stories are typically based on cause and effect. Causality is the engine of most narratives; it pushes the narrative forward. Causality binds together the events that serve as links in a narrative chain. A film usually initiates this propulsion—and thereby hooks us into the story—by forcing us to ask why the events on screen are happening. This is especially the case when a film starts in media res, or in the middle of the action. As a narrative unfolds, we engage with questions of causality by way of character psychology -- since it is usually characters who function as the agents of causality -- we live vicariously through their desires and fears, their flaws and their will to accomplish goals and complete tasks.</p>
                    <p>For Bordwell and Thompson, in fact, this is how we should define characters: as bundles of traits that dictate how they will react to events. In this way film causality is character-based most of the time – events happen and characters react to these events, initiating new causes and new effects.</p>
                    <p>Time in narrative, on the other hand, is governed by three variables: order, duration and frequency. These variables are important for understanding the relationship between plot and story.</p>

                    <p>A narrative typically has a definite beginning and a definite end. As a result of this, narratives are typically contained and highly structured. In other words, narratives, to use that word from last week, have FORM.</p>
                    <p>Three act structure (beginning, middle, end)</p>
                    <p>If we connect this narrative structure to the five principles of form that we learned about last week, we can start to see how we might understand narrative FORMALLY.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When we speak of function, one thing we are asking is to what purpose various elements within the film are put in terms of advancing our understanding of the narrative.</li>
                        <li>When we speak of development, likewise, we are considering the way the parts of a film build upon eachother to create meaning through juxtaposition.</li>
                        <li>And when we think about unity and disunity, we are generally speaking about the ways a film's entire set of relationships fit together – the narrative is a huge part of this. Does the story resolve itself? Does it feel like all the problems opened in the first and second act are somehow solved, for better or worse? If so, we'd probably say the film has some kind of unity, a coherence.</li>
                        <li>But moments of difference and variation, in particular, are part of what allows a story to unfold -- the principle of development, which you might now think about in terms of the development of the film's story over the course of 3 acts, is driven in important ways by the introduction of difference and variation, those forms that disrupt the first act's established equilibrium, introducing a disequilibrium in the second act that must give way to a renewed sense of equilibrium and resolution in the third act.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h2>Narration</h2>
                    <p>Most simply put, narration can be defined simply as the process by which plot presents story information to the viewer. In other words, narration is the term we give for the part of the film's formal system that is concerned with narrative. Narration asks, literally, how does film form narrate the story to you?</p>
                    <p>Narration is: "the process by which story information is made available to us via the plot."</p>
                    <p>For now, we just want to lay out a few key principles of narration, which we'll think about in terms of the range and depth of knowledge that a film produces through plot.</p>
